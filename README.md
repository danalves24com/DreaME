# DreaME
Dreams, as of late, are to be a conscious interpretation of the subconscious processing its recent history during sleep. We can use technology, to subliminally change or spike the unconscious mind using sub 3 milisecond exposures to stimuli. By using DreaME's dream programs, and flashing your subconscious before sleep, you can influence the content of your dreams.
